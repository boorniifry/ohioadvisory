                    <h3>Personally Identifiable Information:</h3>
                    <p>Personally identifiable information of registered securities representatives and advisors is
                        primarily derived from the Securities and Exchange Commission's Investment Adviser Public

                        licensed representative's or advisor's name, firm affiliation, city, state, and ZIP code are
                        disclosed in a basic listing. This basic information is provided to allow for a user to
                        accurately identity a licensed representative or advisor and review his or her services.
                        Ohio Advisory Info is not responsible for the accuracy of any information. All other
                        information found in listings available to users through our website is supplied voluntarily and
                        knowingly made accessible to the public by the licensed securities representative or advisors
                        themselves who has updated his or her professional listings. With the exception of a name and
                        state which cannot be removed by the representative or advisor, licensed professionals
                        interacting with our website may delete other information, or modify information found in their
                        professional listings on Ohio Advisory Info. This includes their firm affiliation, address,
                        telephone number, email address, credentials or other personally identifiable information.
                        Professionals that update their listing constitute their acceptance that Ohio Advisory Info
                        may share such information with users of this website, its partners and agents for purposes
                        related to the AOhio Advisory Infos products and services, including for the purpose of

                    <p><strong>Q:</strong> What if I see an error in my name like if the name is spelled wrong or I
                        recently got married and my name has changed – how do I correct that?<br><strong>A:</strong>
                        Please email us using the form on the contact
                            page.</p>
                    <p><b>3.&nbsp;I am a registered securities representative or advisor. But how do I get my name
                            removed from your site?</b><br>If you are currently licensed, we will not remove your name.
                        If you are unhappy with negative reviews, we will not remove your name either. Your basic
                        licensing information is made available to everyone to protect the public. We respect your
                        privacy and do allow you to remove or modify all personal content with the exception of your
                        name and state which you cannot remove on your own. However, if you have given up your license
                        and you are no longer regulated by the securities industry or you have changed professions, we
                        will remove you permanently from the directory upon written request. Please use the contact form
                        on the "Contact" page. YOU MUST STATE CLEARLY THAT YOU NO LONGER ARE A REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE
                        OR ADVISOR.</p>
                    <p><b>4.&nbsp;What if I see a review and rating that I think should be removed? Can I have a review
                            removed?</b><br>A review will not be removed just because it is a low rating. However, bogus
                        reviews, whether good or bad, will be removed. Inappropriate reviews will also be removed.
                        Reviews written by the professional, by their employees or agents will be removed. If you think
                        a review of yours should be removed, feel free to write to us and tell us why it should be
                        removed. We will consider your request but cannot guarantee we will agree with you. The best way
                        to combat one or two bad reviews is to ask dozens of your satisfied clients to write reviews.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>5.&nbsp;I'm going to pose as a client and review myself numerous times to increase my overall
                            rating.</b><br>NEVER WRITE A REVIEW OF YOURSELF OR HAVE AN EMPLOYEE WRITE A REVIEW OF
                        YOURSELF. We are on the lookout for those self-serving reviews. We use humans, not machines to
                        detect and remove phony reviews. But more importantly, it is a violation of current law. Posing
                        as a client or hiring an outside agency or employee to post positive ratings is a practice known
                        as "astroturfing", and is prohibited.</p>
                    <p><b>6.&nbsp;One of these reviews is false and it's hurting my professional practice! I want to
                            send you a letter demanding that it be removed.</b><br>We do not accept demand letters
                        because it is not our role to determine whether a review is true or false. You might dispute the
                        truth of a review, but your disputing it does not make it false.</p>
                    <p><b>7.&nbsp;If you won't accept a demand letter, I have no choice but to sue you!</b><br>The
                        Communications Decency Act (CDA) is a complete bar to our liability for the statements of others
                        on this website: "No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the
                        publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider." 47
                        U.S.C. § 230. Federal courts have applied this standard on its terms: "By its plain language,
                        Section 230 creates a federal immunity to any cause of action that would make service providers
                        liable for information originating with a third-party user of the service." Zeran v. AOL, 129
                        F.3d 327, 330 (4th Cir. 1997). The ratings on this site are written by our users, not by our
                        company. Thus, under the CDA, we are not the "publisher or speaker" of the ratings, even if they
                        contain false information and we are not liable for defamation, libel, fraud or any other tort
                        claim you might bring.</p>
                    <p><b>8.&nbsp;I think my demand letter would put you on notice that the review is false and
                            defamatory. That makes you liable.</b><br>No, it doesn't. Zeran, 129 F.3d at 227, and the
                        cases following it uniformly hold that it is not up to us to determine whether your demand
                        letter is correct or the review is correct. The CDA gives us complete immunity for the
                        statements that others make on this site.</p>
                    <p><b>9.&nbsp;But you lost your CDA immunity by aggregating the user ratings into an
                            average!</b><br>No. The most instructive case on aggregate ratings is the California Court
                        of Appeals' decision in Gentry v. eBay, which squarely held that such ratings do not transform a
                        publisher into an information content provider. 99 Cal. App. 4th 816, 834 (Cal. App. 2002).</p>
                    <p><b>10.&nbsp;But you lost your CDA immunity by editing the rater's original comments!</b><br>No.
                        Under 230(c)(2)(A), "No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable
                        on account of any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability
                        of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy,
                        excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is
                        constitutionally protected".</p>
                    <p><b>11.&nbsp;I'm going to sue you anyway. Taking down the review is cheaper than paying a
                            lawyer.</b><br>Sounds like a Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation (SLAPP)!
                        Twenty-eight states, including our home state, have passed strict anti-SLAPP laws, authorizing
                        expedited motions to dismiss and giving rise to counterclaims seeking attorneys' fees and
                        liquidated damages.</p>
