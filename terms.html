                    <p>Access to and use of Missouri's Top Advisors services, including the "Ask an Advisor" Program, is
                        provided subject to the following Terms and Conditions Agreement. Your use of Advisor Registry's
                        services constitutes your acceptance of these terms and conditions.</p>
                    <h3>Terms and Conditions Agreement</h3>
                    <p>Before using this service, you should carefully read the following terms and conditions.
                        Information on this site is provided for informational purposes and is not meant to substitute
                        for the advice provided by your own financial advisor. By using the Missouri Top Advisors
                        service, you accept the terms and conditions below.</p>
                    <p>This Agreement describes the terms and conditions applicable to your use of the
                        Missouri Top Advisors service (the "Service"). We may amend these terms and conditions at any
                        time by posting the amended terms on our site. The amended terms shall automatically be
                        effective 30 days after they are initially posted on our site. This Agreement may not be
                        otherwise amended except in a writing signed by both parties. For the purposes of these terms
                        and conditions "user(s)" means any person or entity that accesses or uses the Service,
                        including, but not limited to, financial advisors and their clients.</p>
                    <p>Because we do not and cannot be involved in user-to-user dealings (be they professional
                        engagements or mere communications) in the event that you have a dispute with one or more users,
                        you release us (and our agents and employees) from claims, demands and damages (actual and
                        consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed
                        and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with these disputes. If you are a
                        California resident, you waive California Civil Code section 1542, which states: "A general
                        release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his
                        favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected
                        his settlement with the debtor".</p>
                    <h3>Information and Accuracy</h3>
                    <p>For legal reasons, we cannot nor do we try to control the information provided by other users
                        that is made available through our system. You release us from any and all liability with
                        respect to information entered on or through Missouri Top Advisors that is offensive, harmful or
                        inaccurate.</p>
                    <p>We have no control (and we will not seek to establish control) over the truth or accuracy of a
                        user's postings or content on the Missouri Top Advisors website and Service. Missouri Top Advisors
                        assumes no responsibility for the timeliness, deletion, mis-delivery or failure to store any
                        user communications or personalization settings.</p>
                    <h3>User Communications and Content</h3>

                        accuracy, integrity or quality of this Content. You understand that by using the Service, you
